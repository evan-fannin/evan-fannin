        <p>Denny BnB is an Airbnb-like booking platform, conceived at the request of my brother who has multiple short term rental properties and wants to be able to offer bookings directly to repeat guests. Users can view all houses, book available dates, and see their reservations. The ultimate aim is to add more features like booking management and payments in order to put it into production for use by his guests.</p>
        <p>This project was primarily a way for me to learn full-stack web development using React and Django by doing it! From September to December of 2021, I worked to create this single page application with a RESTful api backend, learning specific skills along the way like user authentication, context and redirects, and testing.</p>

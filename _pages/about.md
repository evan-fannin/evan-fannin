<h3>Hi, I'm Evan!</h3>
<p>I'm a guy from Nashville, Tennessee who's decided he wants nothing other than a career in software engineering.</p>
<p>I have a Bachelor's in mathematics with a minor in computer science, but I started school studying history and political science. Throughout that process, I discovered that I love working with systems and moving parts, which led to my fascination with building tools that move on their own through programming!</p>
<p>In the time I don't spend pursuing my career, I revel in exploring the world physically, linguistically, and literarily.</p>

    <h3>Hi, I'm Evan!</h3>
    <p>I'm a guy from Nashville, Tennessee who wants nothing more than a position as a software engineer!</p>
    <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in mathematics with a minor in computer science, but I started school studying history and political science. Throughout that process, I discovered that I love working with systems and moving parts, which led to my fascination with building tools that move on their own through programming!</p>
    <p>Since graduating in December of 2020, I've been working as a product analyst in town, taking on as many Python responsibilites as I can.</p>
    <p>In the time I don't spend pursuing my career, I revel in exploring the world physically, linguistically, and literarily.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Hi, I'm Evan! Welcome to my site!</h3>
    <p>I'm a software engineer based out of Nashville, TN. I love connecting the dots - learning how things work in different domains and building a mental map of the world. I'm very goal oriented and I enjoy working in an environment where drive and exploratory mindsets are rewarded.</p>
    <p>In my free time I read widely, get outside, travel, and practise my Spanish and Chinese.</p>
    <p>Feel free to peruse my resume, projects, and social links above!</p>
